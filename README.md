## Inspiration

<p>Wastage of food in restaurants¬†, homes¬†, parties and marriages is a big problem in the world and this is prevalent to a large extent in India as well.
Without our knowledge, lot of food is wasted in our home whereas the population of India below the poverty line do not get even one square meal a day!</p>
In a country of 1.6 billion people. 6% of the population in India is rich, 45% of the population is in the middle class and a staggering 59% of the population is below the poverty line.
Starvation is one of the major problems in India and along with that the poor population of India don't have access to basic essentials like clothes and footwear and the Coronavirus Pandemic coupled with the rising job losses has pushed people out towards the brink of poverty and bankruptcy.

Give2Charity bids an effort to bring forth a solution to this problem and reach out to as many poor, malnourished and unemployed inhabitants of India by providing a complete, full fledged and easy to use platform with round the clock support that can be used by anyone in the world to donate money, food, clothes and all other essentials and contribute to the noble cause we are tackling in this project.
