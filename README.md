<p>Wastage of food in restaurants , homes , parties and marriages is a big problem in the world and this is prevalent to a large extent in India as well.
Without our knowledge, lot of food is wasted in our home whereas the population of India below the poverty line do not get even one square meal a day!</p>
In a country of 1.6 billion people. 6% of the population in India is rich, 45% of the population is in the middle class and a staggering 59% of the population is below the poverty line.
Starvation is one of the major problems in India and along with that the poor population of India don't have access to basic essentials like clothes and footwear and the Coronavirus Pandemic coupled with the rising job losses has pushed people out towards the brink of poverty and bankruptcy.
